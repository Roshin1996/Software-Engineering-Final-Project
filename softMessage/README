Soft Message:
A very simple, barebones P2P prototype made with consultation of a few online tutorials. The app allows for a very simple text based chat amongst 2 terminal windows, or more. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

To run, first install Node.js. 

Then, navigate to the "softMessage" folder from a terminal. From here, run the following:
node logic.js name1 name2 name3

Where name1 - name 3 are the available usernames to pick from for the generated room. Theoretically any number will be possible, but with higher numbers, the more chances of overlapping ports, so 3 is recommended for best results. Also, keep usernames fairly short. 

Nothing will happen in the main window. Next, open another terminal, and navigate to the same location, and run the following command:
node logic.js name2 name1 name3

name3 could have also been substituted in the front; the point is that the first name is the user, while the second 2 are peers. After running this, the two windows can chat, and a third can be added in similar fashion. Order of the 2 trailing peers does not matter.

Example:

Terminal1:
node logic.js Vinay Roshin JeanClaude

Terminal2:
node logic.js Roshin Vinay JeanClaude

Terminal3:
node logic.js JeanClaude Vinay Roshin 

After this, all 3 terminals can chat, and any 2 remaining ones can keep chatting even if one leaves.
