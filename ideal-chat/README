Ideal Chat Application: 
A simple text chat app created by following online tutorials. Uses basic web design technologies along with Node.js, and various Node packages such as socket.io to manage P2P connections.

Consists of 4 main functional files:

chat.js
Handles chat logic such as displaying, sending, and receiving messages

index.js
Handles high level logic, like connecting users and disconnecting them to each other

index.html
The code for the structure of the page, loosely

style.css
Handles the visual components

INSTRUCTIONS

To run, first install Node.js. 

Then, simply navigate to the ideal-chat folder in any terminal, and run the following command:
node index.js

After this, go to any browser window and, in the url bar, go to "localhost:3000", and follow the commands to join the room. 

To simulate a chat, either open another tab in the browser, or another browser entirely, and do the same thing. The 2 windows will then be able to communicate with each other.
